     /* Problem 1
       Again, we are looking for numbers that are within the range 10...20 inclusive.
       But this time we are looking for the max value within that range out of the 2 positive int values.
       Return the larger value that is in the range 10...20,
       or return 0 if neither number is in that range.
       Example:
       larger1020(11, 19) --> 19
       larger1020(19, 11) --> 19
       larger1020(11, 9) --> 11

    /* Problem 2
      Create the string to look like it's going up; like a hill. To do this we need to take the last 3 characters
      and make them uppercase. Even if there's less than 3 characters, just make whatever is there uppercase.
      Doing this allows the string to look like it's going up and down depending on if begins with uppercase or not.
      Tip: str.toUpperCase() returns the uppercase version of a string
      Return a new string where the last 3 characters are now in upper case.
      Example:
      goingUp("Hello") --> "HeLLO"
      goingUp("hi there") --> "hi thERE"
      goingUp("hi") --> "HI"

    public static String goingUp(String hill) {

        return null;
    }
}
